                                    You will now receive a programme of structured psychological support from our specialist app;
                                    ADHD Assistant. It is designed to help you work on the individual traits of ADHD,
                                    that we believe you have, on an ongoing basis, and we hope you will be able to make good use of it.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-black lead">
                                    To do so, please go to one of the links below, depending on the device you use and from there, download the app.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-black lead">
                                    Once you have downloaded it, Enter the Activation Code:2023
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-black lead">
                                    On first log in – and every few weeks thereafter – you will be asked to complete a 	test.
                                    Please complete as instructed and, once you do, you will then be taken to the main app.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-black lead">
                                    Inside the app you will find a list of “7 Commitments”. These are exercises that
                                    you should do every day and they are divided into morning and afternoon
                                    exercises. As you complete the exercises, your performance will be recorded in
                                    the stats tab. There,you can see how well you are doing in terms of completing the exercises each day.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-black lead">
                                    These exercises are specially designed to help you work on the core areas of deficit
                                    that people who have ADHD Traits often demonstrate. By working on them 	in this way, every day,
                                    you will likely reduce the impact these deficits have in your 	life over time, gradually rewiring and recalibrating your responses and behaviours.
                                    The key is persistence. In order to help you keep on track, the app will send you notifications a couple of times a day and, for this reason,
                                    we ask you to keep the 	app notifications on. If you work with it, you will start to notice a difference 	over time.
                                </p>

                                    I will also forward these instructions to you by email. Good luck and we very much
                                    hope that you will be able to utilise and persevere with the support provided and
                                    consequently see improvements in the future. Thank you again for taking the time
                                    to engage in this assessment process and we wish you all the very best for the 	future.
