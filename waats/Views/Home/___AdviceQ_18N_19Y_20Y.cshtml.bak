                                Based on your answers, I can say that it is highly unlikely that you meet the threshold for a diagnosis of ADHD.
                                This is based on official national clinical guidelines and expert criteria that have been designed specialist Consultants.
                                Not having a full diagnosis, however, does not mean that you don’t have some real issues and that you couldn’t do with some real help.
                                You clearly have some traits of ADHD and this is inevitably something that inhibits you in your life,
                                and something you can benefit from some help around, which I would like to set up for you today if you’d like.
                                So now you have 2 choices.
                                <i class="text-primary text-bg-light small blockquote-footer">One option is the immediate support that I can get for you right now.</i>

                                We have an <strong>app</strong> that has also been developed by specialists in the field. It is specifically designed to work on those traits
                                that you have and help you live a more balanced, less stressed and better quality of life.
                                All you have to do is click on the yes button below and we’ll take you off the waiting list and get you that support via
                                our app today. The app will be like your daily companion and I’ll walk you through exactly how it works and how
                                you can get the most out of it.
